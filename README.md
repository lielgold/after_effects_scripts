# change_layer_names_to_start_time_and_vice_versa:

Undo changes to layers inPoint / start time. This was used in the transition from offline to online editing, when the layers' inPoints would sometime change unexpectedly.
To do this, first update the layer names to reflect their respective inPoints or start times. To undo, synchronize the inPoints or start times with their new names.

1. Press the checkmark at the bottom - "Use layer inPoint instead of layer start time". 
2. Press "rename layer names to their start time".
3. Move the layers in the timeline window.
4. Press "move layers start time to their name" to bring them back to their original inPoints.
